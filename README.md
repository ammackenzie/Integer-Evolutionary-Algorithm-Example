# Integer-Evolutionary-Algorithm-Example
Arbitrary evolutionary algorithm in Java demonstrating integer representation, mutation, multiple selection methods, and multiple crossover operations.

Customisable parameter n will auto generate a target sorted integer array of size n. Evolutionary algorithm will attempt to solve for maximum fitness equal to n, with each correct array index incrementing genome fitness. 

EA Techniques Demonstrated
 - Tournament selection and proportionate selection
 - Population initialisation and replacement operators
 - Three parent crossovers available: uniform, one-point, and two-point
 - Mutation operator
